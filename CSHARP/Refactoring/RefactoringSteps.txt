1. The first thing is to push the implementation of the GetIngredient and GetPasta out
	Since there's no output yet, it's risky, but low risk.
	Create an interface IDispenser with the same interface.
	Then move the implementation a Dispenser class.
	Inject it through the PastaMaker, and now we're working against an interface.

	Note though, that with complex implementation, we might want to go with a derived class, not an interface. Just like this implementation, we report than continue with the implementation.
	In other cases, we may want to mock something to return.

2. Create a MockDispenser class in the test code. It implements the IDispenser interface.
	Only, its implementation is writing to the console what it's passed.
